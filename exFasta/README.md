#Test the script:
To test the script run change to directory and run:

'python extract_fasta.py signalp.out translated_cds.fa'

  signalp.out:              332 sequence names
  translated_cds.fa:        6484 protein sequences 
  signalp.out.fa:           332 protein sequences

After a successful run the script outputs the extracted sequences to termal and saves the sequences in a file named after the sequence name file
