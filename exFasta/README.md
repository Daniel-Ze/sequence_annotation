# Test the script:
To test the script change to directory and run:

> python extract_fasta.py signalp.out translated_cds.fa

  * signalp.out:              **332** sequence names
  * translated_cds.fa:        **6484** protein sequences 
  * signalp.out.fa:           **332** protein sequences

After a successful run the script outputs the extracted sequences to the terminal and saves the sequences in a file named after the sequence name file.

***Don't use this script to extract reads from NGS data.***
