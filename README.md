# sequence_annotation
Tools for sequence annotation such as fgenesh (softberry), conserved domain search (NCBI), LTR-harvest (genome-tools).

Output of the aformentioned online tools will not allow direct annotation of sequence files therefore I'm trying to 
generate a set of python scripts that allow the generation of the GFF3 annotation file format.
